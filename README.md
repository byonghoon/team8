# team8 : Automatic License Plate Recognition System

## Project Overview

Law enforcement today frequently utilize automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technologies to enhance their enforcement abilities, expand data collection, and to provide the capability for law enforcement to automatically compare vehicle license plates against lists of stolen, wanted, and other vehicles of interest while on patrol. The goal of this project is to design a robust and secure ALPR system for use by law enforcement for the project sponsor, WeCatchEm Inc., that will launch this new product later this year.  Key motivators for this project are:
Select the best architecture/solution based on the results of this competition among the teams in this course.
Ensure secure system communication with the backend server that will be accessed from the police vehicle via a 5G cellular network.
Fast and accurate license plate lookup and response times.
User interface that is intuitive that requires minimal human interaction.
